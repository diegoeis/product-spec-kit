# Start

These instructions help guide the user who wants to start building a specification. This specification can range from a PRD, user story, or tasks. We should guide them through this construction by following the instructions below.

Use the information provided by the user to gain context and guide them in deciding the correct option. If they haven't specified what type of specification they'd like to build, ask a question in the format of the options below:

```
What type of specification would you like to build?

- A: PRD (Product Requirements Document)
- B: User Story
- C: Task
```

If the user provides an empty or incoherent response, ask again.

You should follow the instructions in the workflows below according to the user's chosen option:
- If they choose PRD, use `workflows/prod.spec.prd.md`
- If they choose to create a story or task, use `workflows/prod.spec.task.md`
