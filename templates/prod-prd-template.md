## TL;DR

- **What** to solve:

  - {Business impact 1: How does this benefit the business?}
  - {User benefit 1: How does this help users?}
  - {Strategic value: Why is this important now?}

- **How** to solve: 
  - {Solution approach 1: High-level solution concept}

  - {Differentiator: What makes this solution unique?}

## Context

{Provide 3-4 paragraphs (max 250 words) covering:
1. Current situation and pain points
