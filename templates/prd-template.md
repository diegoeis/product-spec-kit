## Constitution Validation

Before finalizing PRD, verify:

- [ ] ✅ **User Value First**: Every requirement has clear user benefit
- [ ] ✅ **Testable Criteria**: Success metrics are measurable
- [ ] ✅ **Complete Context**: Document is self-contained
- [ ] ✅ **Prioritized Work**: Clear P0/P1/P2 designation
- [ ] ✅ **Consistent Terminology**: Same terms used throughout

## Usage Tips

**Start Broad, Then Narrow**:
1. Fill Executive Summary first
2. Define Problem & Goals
3. Detail Requirements
4. Add technical details last

**Iterate**:
- Use clarify-prd workflow to improve
- Review with stakeholders early
- Update as you learn more

**Right-size**:
- Simple feature? Use short format
- Complex product? Use full format
- Multiple features? One PRD per major feature

**Keep Updated**:
- Mark version on each update
- Document major decision changes
- Archive old versions
